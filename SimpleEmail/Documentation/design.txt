Simple Email Design
-------------------

Overview:  This application is designed with the following goals in mind

		   1) To minimize the amount of features for managing large email accounts
		   2) To manage large amounts of message filters
		   3) To manage multiple email accounts using POP, or IMAP specifications
		   4) To manage a local email data store, per account
		   5) To manage email folders from the account
		   6) To provide a database for message summary caching, to enhance performance
		   7) To provide a compressed message (local) store for fast retrieval and small disk footprint
		   8) Email blacklists*** (additional to filters)
		   9) Idle email download (performance)
		   10) Junk / Delete expunge step (get rid of black listed emails immediately, without any added data storage)
